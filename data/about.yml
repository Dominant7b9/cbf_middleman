  title: Why we're were
  text: We design workspaces and install furniture, but that’s not what drives us. Our core purpose
        is to Create Culture, Build Community, and Enrich Lives. We seek to achieve this goal for every client 
        through each project we undertake and the long-term customer relationships we’ve developed over the 
        last three decades are a testament to that commitment.
